More about the sf package can be found here https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/sf.pdf and here https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html .

The second section is an ecological example using the Ecological Vegetation Classes (EVCs) from Victoria, Australia and analysis the change in time between extant vegetation and 1750s predictions for high altitude areas.
